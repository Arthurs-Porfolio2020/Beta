        <h3>Teacher</h3>
        <p>I am a big advocate of continuing education and enjoy sharing my knowledge to others.<br>
          In my previous role, I've had the privilege of representing Verizon and provide trainings to small businesses around the nation on how to use <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/my-business/">My Business Assistant (MBA)</a>.<br>
          MBA is an innovative tool that provides Verizon services when and where you want.</p>

        <h3>Fixer</h3>
        <p>One of my greatest passion is to help others. I'm always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and try new things. I enjoy doing repairs on home appliances, cars,and any electronic devices. The highlight of
          reparing anything is having the opportunity to see the smiles on others faces when the job is done.</p>
